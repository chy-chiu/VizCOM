    <h1>Baseline Drift Removal</h1>
    <p>
        The Baseline Drift Removal function attempts to flatten each pixel's signal. 
        First, it finds relative minima in each signal and displays the detected baseline points from confirmation. 
        After confirmation, the detected baseline is subtracted from the corresponding signal.

            <h2>Baseline Point Finding</h2>
            <p>
                To find baseline points, we search each pixel's signal for relative minima using SciPy.signal's
                <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html">find_peaks</a>
                function.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="parameter">prominence</span> parameter defines the minimum prominence a point must have 
                in order to be considered for the baseline. Prominence of a given point is equal to the depth of the valley 
                relative to the lowest neighboring peak
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="parameter">threshold</span> parameter defines the maximum <span class="math">y</span> value that 
                will be considered for the baseline.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="parameter">distance</span> parameter defines the minimum time required between baseline 
                points. If two baseline points are found within
                <span class="parameter">distance</span> ms of each other, the lower of the two points will be kept.
            </p>

            <h2>Baseline Interpolation & Removal</h2>
            <p>
                Once the user confirms the detected baseline points, baselines are constructed via linear interpolation 
                between baseline points. The first and last baseline points are extended horizontally to beginning and 
                end of the signal, respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                These baselines are then subtracted from the signal at each pixel. Values that lie below the baseline 
                are set to <span class="math">0</span>.
